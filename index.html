            <ul>
                <li>1906: Born as Grace Brewster Murray in New York City</li>    
                <li>1928: Graduated from Vassar college where she studied maths and physics</li>
                <li>1930: She receieved a master's degree in maths and married Vincent Foster Hopper</li>
                <li>1934: She earned a Ph.D in mathematics, an amzing feat for women at that time</li>
                <li>1943: She joined the U.S Naval Reserve due to the emergence of the World War || </li>
                <li>1944: Grace Hopper was assigned to the Bureau of ordinance Computation project as a lieutenant</li>
                <li>1949: Her desire to continue working with computers led to her working with private industries.
                    First, with Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation and later with Remington Rand, where she oversaw
                    programming for the UNIVAC computer.
                </li>
                <li>1952: A compiler renders worded instructions into code that can be read by computer. She, along
                    with her team created the first compiler for computer languages. This compiler was a precursor 
                    for the Common Business Oriented Language, or COBOL, a widely adapted language that would soon become very popular 
                    around the world.
                </li>
                <li>1986: At age 79, with 1 active years in the Navy, she retired, a rear admiral and the oldest serving officer in 
                    office.
                </li>
                <li>1991: Grave was awarded the National Medal of Technology, becoming the first female individual recipient of the honor</li>

            <li>2004: The University of Missouri honored Grace Hopper with a computer museum on its campus, dubbed “Grace’s Place".
                On display are early computers and computer components to educator visitors on the evolution of the technology.
            </li>    
            <li>Grace Hopper's legacy included encouraging young women to learn how to program. The Grace Hopper Celebration of 
                Women In Computing Conference is a technical conference that encourages women to become part of the world of 
                computing. The Association for Computing Machinery offers a Grace Murray Hopper Award to women who distinguish
                 themselvesin the world of technology.</li>
         <li>2013: On her birthday, Grace Hopper was rememebered with a "Google Doddle".</li>

                It was warm in the summer of 1945; the windows were always open and the screens were not very good. One day the Mark II stopped when a relay failed. They finally found the cause of the failure: inside one of the relays, beaten to death by the contacts, was a moth. The operator carefully fished
                 it out with tweezers, taped it in the logbook, and wrote under it "first actual bug found.” –Kathleen Broome Williams</blockquote>
